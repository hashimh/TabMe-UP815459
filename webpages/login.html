        <h3 class='subheading'>About</h3>
        <p>This application is used to help musicians transcribe music from their instrument into a tablature format, from tablature symbols for lead guitar parts to
          custom chord creation for rhythm parts. This app also allows tablatures to be shared across the Internet, for all teachers, students and general guitarists
          to have access to.
        <br>This application will allow tab sheets to be transcribed, using a simple fret board to interact with to note down which notes are to be
        played and when. Multiple stave options allow for multiple parts of the same song to be transcribed and saved as one document, making it
        easy to create tablatures not only for small riffs, but also songs as a whole.
      <br>Other features include an audio playback option, to ensure the sheet that has been written sounds just as the user would like, as well as
      search oppertunities to find specific community-created tablatures.
        </p>
        <h3 class='subheading'>Help</h3>
