        <p>This application is used to help musicians transcribe music from their instrument into a tablature format, using this easy-to-use web application, which
          also allows tab sheets to be saved, exported and shared with other accounts.
        </br>This application will allow tab sheets to be transcribed, using a simple fret board to interact with to note down which keys are to be
        played and when.
      </br>Other features include a playback option, to ensure the sheet that has been written sounds just as the user would like.
        <p>Please sign in to access the application and access all of its features.</p>
        </p>
